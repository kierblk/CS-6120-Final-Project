In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial technology, the ability to distill complex information into actionable insights stands paramount. This project, centered on the summarization and sentiment analysis of Federal Reserve FOMC Minutes & Statements, aims to leverage cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to unlock nuanced understandings of central bank communications. Undertaken within the context of my role at a FinTech company expanding into regulatory and central bank coverage, this endeavor seeks to bridge the gap between sophisticated NLP methodologies and practical financial analysis, providing a foundation for informed decision-making in a domain critical to our companyâ€™s growth and innovation.

## Objective
This project aims to leverage NLP techniques for summarizing and performing sentiment analysis on the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting minutes and statements. The goal is to extract key insights and sentiment trends from these documents, offering a clearer understanding of the Federal Reserve's perspective on economic conditions and policy decisions over time.

## Data
Utilizing the "Federal Reserve FOMC Minutes & Statements Dataset" from Kaggle, which comprises text data of FOMC meeting minutes and statements, providing a comprehensive overview of economic policy discussions.
